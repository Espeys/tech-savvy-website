        Nowadays, we are able to manipulate the Internet and can be accessed by anyone, whether young or old, as long as you know how to use it. We spend most of our time having chit chat conversations with our friends, posting what’s on our mind, reading posts and articles or putting some frank or humorous comments. But without noticing it, we are also being manipulated by the Internet. As we consume its function, it also consumes our lives. We have this mindset that the Internet is our life guide and guard, so we tend to believe that everything on it is true and beneficial to us.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        The information that we may read on the Internet does not occur naturally or randomly, but was created by someone with specific purposes, like your Facebook friend only wanting to spread hoax, an amateur journalist becoming a professional one or a concern citizen that may help you for your assignments. This information may be fraud or a reliable one, but who knows which is which?
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Fraud informations are the informations widespread in the world of social media such as Facebook. It was because of the user per se that even you may also spread this kind of information. Malicious intentions, lack of ample knowledge to support details, and careless stating are some of the reasons why there is such information.

    <p>
      Hoax is one kind of information that we may read in social media and it is the information that most people shared.  It was created of creative and fictional minds of people as they want to deceive other people. The best examples are celebrities were killed by celebrity death hoax, even they are still alive, edited photos of class suspensions even there is no official announcement yet and different scandals of celebrities and even of the ordinary people.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Online news and information providers are also called as the “Fifth Estate”. It means that those are the things/people that has a power to influence the mass. So, they must be alert and fast to information and deliver it as soon as possible. But, it has no assurance that it is accurate and precise. Sometimes, because of the alertness of the providers or being pressured by other providers, they are being unaware that they unintentionally mistaken some details on their reports or do not have ample details because of hastily research that will result to fraud information. For example, there is this Filipino news provider that stated news about the incident of shooting of one cyclist as well as the suspected shooter. Many people reacted and get mad to the suspect but said suspect went to authority wanting to clear his name because he is not involved on that incident and what’s the news provider stated is falsehood. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Think people that you admire, then he/she will be compared to another people. How are you going to describe them? Most of the time, you will going to say all of his/her pleasant characteristics and the things he/she has that the other doesn’t have. In this scenario, bias is noticeable.  News and information may also have bias, when the news or information is in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Do you play the game “Pass the Message”? It's a game having a line and the first person will tell what he/she received to the next person. As the game goes on, the information that has been passed may become few or many than what really the message is. When it comes to last person, the information has been altered and different from what the first person said. In world of cyber space, it is like playing pass the message. We might see different stories and articles, but who knows if there someone added or lessened the thought of it.
