        Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and such are meant for known usefulness, either for wider social interactions, sort of informative sites  or significant for communication of today’s. With its accessibility with just the use of laptops, tablets, android phones and such, they have been the center of every teenager’s every day and night as well as elders’ who are aware of modern technology. Yet with its incredible uses, it is now drowning the lives of people of today’s generation to a deeper world, a world much away of what kind of world social media is intended to build. Yes, social media is of good purposes but as time goes by abused social media is nothing but of negative effects.

        Dependency on social media may be beneficial or damaging. And as I want to discuss the disadvantages of it, I want you to see the damages social media may bring. Starting with the physical health impairment, primarily of how physical body is being damaged, is the usage of gadgets for social media sites. Tablets, smart phones, laptops and such are being in demand as of today for fun time-killing, texting, calling, chatting, others for studying but mostly for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social network sites. With a lot of purpose, people tend to be hooked on using these gadgets that even with the slightest feel of boredom; they will look for their phones or what to use to do something online. Some are nearly addicted on gadgets they have for what it contains seems addicting to them, like reading stuffs on Twitter and either interesting or non-interesting posts on Facebook or watching the most senseless video on YouTube they found funny yet obviously means nothing. These doings obviously cause sedentary lifestyle for a person. How could I tell? Why? Would you be able to walk safely while browsing on your Facebook account? What about doing household chores while busily watching videos on YouTube? Or would you sweat on using your Twitter account tweeting what you want to say and share? Definitely not! Once you have been into your phone connected to an internet connection, surely you will find your most comfortable place and position in the house (commonly beside an electrical socket for charging purposes) and will do nothing but to look, stare and have eye-to-eye contact with it the whole day and will not be able to use up the stored in energy and exercise your body. Next is what have been just mentioned, the eye contact with gadgets. Long-time using of phone or tablets greatly affects our visions with the direct contact of our eyes on the screens, which releases radiation that is obviously harmful. Eye exposure to radiation is tolerant but too much radiation to our eyes will definitely damage every one’s vision and is all from those gadgets.

        Emotional as well as mental health may also be harmed by this technology. Through social media, emotional connection becomes lesser because authentic expressions of feelings are slowly being lost. Conversations through chatting today are filled with a lot of expressions way far from what do the persons are feeling. She typed “ha-ha” when in person she’s crying her heart out and he may type “sorry” when in reality he is smiling, doesn’t care and doesn’t feel sorry at all. See, that the social media communication can stop the learning of how to express and show real emotions because of being hid behind those sites and gadgets and then, the mental health, where focus is being pushed aside. Social media are distractions people tend to see when studying, working or doing something. They lose their focus just by seeing their phones and automatically remember all their accounts. Some having the mentality of wanting to have more friends and followers both on Twitter and Facebook accounts so instead of accomplishing what are needed to be done they are distracted to just be active online at be up-to-date. Would they be able to get their degree with them being so-called “famous”?

        And ironically the social health infliction social media brings. “Chat you tomorrow friend!” replaced “See you tomorrow!” The communications of social networking provide is undeniably useful yet loses the face-to-face communication skills and connection. Circle of friends may be at the same place right in front of each other yet do nothing but check on phones and such. Some tend to be awkward personally but in chat conversation seems to have been friends for years and others hide behind those screens to socialize. Social affection is definitely lost because of this technology so we should make sure the balanced using of social media for enough and right benefits without losing what is the sense of developing technology.
