          Nowadays, we are able to manipulate the Internet and can be accessed by anyone, whether young or old, as long as you know how to use it. But without noticing it, we are also being manipulated by the Internet. As we consume its function, it also consumes our lives. We have this mindset that the Internet is our life guide and guard, so we tend to believe that everything on it is true and beneficial to us.

          Yet with its incredible uses, it is now drowning the lives of people of today’s generation to a deeper world, a world much away of what kind of world social media is intended to build.
