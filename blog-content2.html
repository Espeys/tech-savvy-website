        We are now living in 21st century society and the ambiance is so technological. Wherever you go, there is someone holding their latest smartphone or high-tech equipment of certain establishment. Innovations in technology are inevitable. Every move of the hands of the clock, creativity strikes and ideas come flowing on creator’s mind. 

      </p><br>
      <p>
        We can’t immediately notice the big changes of technology because it changes little by little, as the time passes by. Mobile phones are staple devices that we must have. During the early years, the appearance and functionality of mobile phones are way different on the mobile phones that we have now as it turns into smartphones. Smart phones are mobile phones that can be called as handheld computers, since it has its operating system and can have Internet access, software, data storage and other computer functions.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Smartphone seems won the race of innovation of technologies. Why? Because every year, smartphones are being upgraded into newer version with new functionality and added specifications. If you are going to see the new smartphone’s specifications of any brand, you can see that it has higher specs than the previous model of smartphones like 5 megapixels camera lens into 15 megapixels or 32 GB internal storage into 64 GB internal storage.  But the most noticeable change of smartphone is its size where it becomes bigger and bigger yet it slimmer and slimmer.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        Besides of smartphones, there are technologies that was invented or innovated by brilliant and creative minds that will shape the future and change the world.  One of it is the well-known Virtual Reality Technology. It is a headgear device which can turn your real environment into virtual environment with the aid of computer 3D-simulation and it allow the user to interact with virtual objects. That virtual environment looks real making you think that you are there, but you aren’t. This technology may be helpful for communicating and socializing because user would be able to do that and also being used now for studies like simulation as well for entertainment.

        Another technology that we find helpful to us is Li-Fi internet. Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) internet which is an innovation of Wi-Fi internet uses LED (Light Emitting Diodes) to send data at 224 GB speed that can allow downloading 18 movies of 1.5 GB in just a second. It works once a small microchip fit into a LED bulb and when illumination of bulb started, wireless data transmission also started. In the future, it is expected that billions of Li-Fi will be deployed worldwide.

        When we say future technologies, there will always be a connotation of robots. We can’t deny the fact that the time will come, the society will be dominated by the robots especially those AI (Artificial Intelligence) robots, because as of today, robots are starting to contribute big roles on big countries like Japan and United States of America. In Japan, there are many robots that are now being created some are for attraction, but most of them are used as their accompaniment in their daily lives with incredible purposes like weather forecasting and factory workers. The innovations of Japan when it comes to robots are very intense where they make robots like a human, that can think, feel and have emotions and do some of human activities. While in USA, robots are focused for military purposes and space expeditions. Both countries are well-known when it comes to technological innovations and is unstoppable as they will definitely continue developing for better.

        And as the time goes by, technology will become more widespread, more powerful, more developed and is expected that more innovative and creative ideas will be applied for the betterment of the world.
